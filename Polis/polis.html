<h1>Greek Polis Data</h1>
<!--<p>This map does not directly focus on staseis (conflict). However, there may be a relation between the level of Greek influence in a city (Hellenicity), the level of Democracy in a city, and conflict between cities based on the relation of these two variables.</p>-->
<!--<h2>Hypothesis: There is a direct correlation between whether a city is a Democracy and whether it is Greek. &#45;&#45; If a city is known to be of Greek culture and influence, it is almost certainly a democratically run polis.</h2>-->
<h2>Hypothesis: The more Greek (or <i>Hellenistic</i>), the better the chances of being democratic.</h2>
<p>Based on the polis data (see reference at bottom) it seems there is a direct relationship between the likelihood of a city being a democracy and it's Hellenicity. -- Except for one city of mixed Hellenicity and other cultures and a city of uncertain influence, all known democratic cities were Greek. Though <u>staseis</u>u isn't directly invoked in this hypothesis, further research into the connection between civil war and a city's democracy would be warranted. NOTE: In order to thin a crowded map, only cities with a controlling area of 100 square km or more, are displayed.</p>
<p><u><b>City Color Key:</b></u></p>
<p>Democracy: Red = 0 (unknown), Blue = 1 (no democracy), Green = 2 (had democracy)
<p>Hellenicity: Red = 0 (unknown), Blue = 1 (most Greek), Green = 2 (mixed), Orange = 3 (most barbarian)
