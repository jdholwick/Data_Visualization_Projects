        <h1>Star Wars Ep. IV Character Interactions Vs. Cultural Awareness</h1>
        <p>One might think that the Star Wars films' characters' popularities and familiarities with the public are proportional to the overall number of interactions and scenes they have in the movie. In other words, the more interactions a character has with others and the more scenes they appear in, the more intertwined into the movie's plot that character should be, one could surmise. Therefore, the more interactions and scene appearances a character has one could also suppose that character would have a similar awareness within the culture because the character with more interactions and scenes should have a larger significance. Judging by the data though, this reasoning does not seem to hold up fully. I do not have data on how popular or well known certain characters are, but anecdotally, the hypothesis does not seem to be entirely correct. Some characters that seem almost incidental (e.g., Biggs or Beru) have a surprising number of interactions and screen time. <b>Thus, my hypothesis would be as follows: Interactions with other mid to main characters and the number of scenes they have, has a mild to weak connection with how well or unwell known a character is in the culture.</b></p>
